The medical comorbidity grade and operative outcomes were defined in accordance with the recommended reporting standards and best practice documents from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and European Society for Vascular Surgery. Complications were recorded as perioperative (<30 days) or late (>1 month) and classified as graft-related or procedurerelated. The complications were described as mild (spontaneous resolution or with nominal intervention, did not prolong the hospital stay, and/or did not cause permanent disability), moderate (required significant intervention, prolonged hospitalization for >24 hours, resulted in a minor amputation, or was associated with a minor disability that did not interfere with normal daily activities), or severe (necessitated a major surgical, medical, and/or endovascular intervention or resulted in prolonged convalescence, major amputation, permanent disability, or death). Major amputations were classified as transfemoral or transtibial. Minor amputations were any toe or forefoot amputation and were not considered in the analysis of freedom from amputation. Successful revascularization of the treated segment was defined as the absence of early (<30 days) reocclusion or persistent forefoot ischemia or major amputation or death within 24 hours.
