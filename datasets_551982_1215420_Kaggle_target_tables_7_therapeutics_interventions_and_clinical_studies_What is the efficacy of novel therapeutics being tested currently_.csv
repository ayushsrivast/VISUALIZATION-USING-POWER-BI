Compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, most of these predicted drugs could form more hydrogen bonds with 2019-nCoV Mpro, thus may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir. It should be noted that these results were obtained solely by in silico predictions, further experiments are needed to validate the efficacy of these drugs. The binding pockets of these drugs on Mpro are conserved between SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro, indicating the potential of these drugs as inhibitors for other coronaviruses with similar Mpro binding sites and pocket structures.",-,-,Simulation,4/22/20

Since these compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record and shown to be effective against various ailments, we suggest that they should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease.",-,Y,Editorial,4/22/20
